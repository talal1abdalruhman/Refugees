# Refugees
By participating in "The Crown Prince Award for Best Government Service Application"
competition (2020). I have designed and built the "Refugees" app, which was designed to help
refugees in Jordan settle and integrate into the community by facilitating their access to
services.

It's a free application, which serves as a comprehensive guide for every refugee on Jordanian territory, and it's provides a great deal of information on the procedures to be followed as soon as the refugee enters the country through health services, education, stability and integration into society. It also provides means for communication with service providers and access to the most important locations of any refugee, such as health centres, hospitals and branches of the Office of the High Commissioner and its offices in all governorates of the Kingdom, In order to ensure that families separated by war are reunited and unable to communicate, the user of the app can search, communicate and meet with one of his family members or friends (users of the app).

## Application services:
* ### Reunion your family:
  The user can create search accounts for their family, relatives, and friends (users of the app) and send a request to communicate, meet and reunite with them.
* ### Paperwork instructions:
  The users of the application find all the procedures to be followed in order to correct their situation in Jordan and to integrate themselves with the local community, from the registration of their data when performing it through the service card (security card) to the work permit.
* ### UNHCR:
  UNHCR branches and offices are numerous and widespread throughout the country, and here the refugee can identify all branches and help offices in addition to the community support centers and access them through their sites or communicate with any of them by telephone or e-mail.
* ### Education:
  A detailed explanation of Jordan's education systems and how refugee children are integrated into the Jordanian educational system. This section also provides a range of discounts from a group of Jordanian universities as well as a total of scholarships for refugees.
* ### Health Services:
  This section provides a detailed explanation of all health services provided to refugees within the country and those supported by UNHCR, with access to sites and communication with service providers.
  
## Application languages:
